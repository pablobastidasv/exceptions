## New repository

Now the library is available in maven central, so the `jitpack.io` repository is
not needed and the dependency group as changed.

Now the dependency is the below.

### Maven

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.pablobastidasv</groupId>
    <artifactId>exceptions</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
``` 

### Gradle

```groovy
compile "io.github.pablobastidasv:exceptions:2.0.0"
```

## Mappers

Mongodb and EJB mappers were removed in pro of keep the library usable to any JaxRS service.

## Now with support to `Code` in Exceptions

The `BaseException` class was added to support code in any custom exception.

### `BusinessException` and `SystemException` now with code.

Now when a `BusinessException` or `SystemException` is instantiated a `code` can be added 
and this code will be reflected on the response JSON message.

### Message Example

```json
{
  "code": "BEX-404",
  "message": "Resource not found."
}
``` 

## CDI 1.2

CDI version into `beans.xml` file was updated to `1.2`.

## Prefix on code

Added option to customize prefix on custom exception that extends BaseException.

## New `ResourceNotFoundException`

New exception to throw when a resource is not found. 

This handle as custom prefix `BEX`
