## Mappers

Mongodb and EJB mappers were removed in pro of keep the library usable to any JaxRS service.

## Now with support to `Code` in Exceptions

The `BaseException` class was added to support code in any custom exception.

### `BusinessException` and `SystemException` now with code.

Now when a `BusinessException` or `SystemException` is instantiated a `code` can be added 
and this code will be reflected on the response JSON message.

### Message Example

```json
{
  "code": "BEX-404",
  "message": "Resource not found."
}
``` 

## CDI 1.2
